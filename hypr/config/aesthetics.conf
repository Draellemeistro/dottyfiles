# NOOB-NOTE: Aesthetic Settings in Hyprland
# This section defines how your windows look and behave on the screen. It covers window
# layouts, spacing, borders, animations, and more, allowing you to customize your desktop
# experience for both appearance and functionality.

# Tip: Play around with the gaps, borders, and layout to make your desktop look and work
# the way you want. Enable animations for smoother window transitions!
# For more info, visit: https://wiki.hyprland.org

#workspace = 8, floating:0, rounding:true, decorate:true, gapsin:10, gapsout:20
#workspace = 9, floating:0, rounding:true, decorate:true, gapsin:10, gapsout:20
#workspace = 0, floating:0, rounding:true, decorate:true, gapsin:10, gapsout:20
#workspace = SPECIAL, floating:0, rounding:true, decorate:true, gapsin:5, gapsout:5
#workspace = IMGEN, floating:0, rounding:true, decorate:true, gapsin:5, gapsout:5

# Customization Tips:
# - You can apply settings like rounding, decoration, or gaps to individual workspaces.
#   Example: workspace = 1, monitor:DP-2, rounding:true, gapsin:5, gapsout:15
#   This would give workspace 1 on DP-2 a rounded appearance with inner and outer window gaps.

# See the following resources for more info:
# - https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Workspace-Rules/
# Ref https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Workspace-Rules/
# "Smart gaps" / "No gaps when only"
# uncomment all if you wish to use that.
# workspace = w[tv1], gapsout:0, gapsin:0
# workspace = f[1], gapsout:0, gapsin:0
# windowrulev2 = bordersize 0, floating:0, onworkspace:w[tv1]
# windowrulev2 = rounding 0, floating:0, onworkspace:w[tv1]
# windowrulev2 = bordersize 0, floating:0, onworkspace:f[1]
# windowrulev2 = rounding 0, floating:0, onworkspace:f[1]
